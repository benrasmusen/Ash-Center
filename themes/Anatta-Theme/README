This is simply my standard blank HTML5 Wordpress theme. I use it as a jumping-off point for my
projects. It is based heavily on the "Blank" theme by Chris Coyier (it can be found at digwp.com).
The original theme is HTML4, so I HTML5'd it up and am adding a couple of stuff such as:
- four widget areas in convenient places for me: Header, Nav (for WP3 menu), Sidebar, Footer
- WP3 menus (create your menus and add as widgets within WP)
- a bunch of stuff in the functions.php file
- my very specific, and probably wrong, HTML5 document structure. If you think it is wrong, (for
  example, I don't think that I'm using <aside> correctly), let me know. A good thing, though - I am
  not using a wrapper div. The .body class works just fine for that in most cases.

That document structure is as follows:
BODY [body class, not to be confused with .body]
-HEADER.body
-NAV.body
-SECTION.body [.index .page .single .archive]
--aside
--article [post class]
---header
---section
---footer
----section.comments
-----article[.alt]
------header
------[comment text]
--nav.pagination
---ul
---li (there are two li's, one for "prev posts" and one for "next posts")
-FOOTER.body

I use a modified Toucan CSS Reset combined with some ideas from the CSS LESS framework (media
queries for different screen sizes). I also place my CSS files in a <theme>/css folder and that
location is used in the header.php file of the theme. The normal style.css is used only for theme
information.

I use "box-sizing: border-box" in my reset stylesheet for layout elements. This means that browsers
will calculate width and height to INCLUDE padding and border on those elements... see
http://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/ for more info on this. This works in Gecko/Webkit browsers, Opera,
and IE 8+. See below for my IE7- workaround.

There are a couple template html files for easy development.

My IE fallback system is pretty specific to my workflow as well:
- For IE9, I do nothing at this time
- IE8 is caught in the [if lt IE 9] conditional comment that contains the html5shiv and ie.css (IE
  stylesheet) so adjustments can be made to the layout if needed.
- IE7 and IE6 are also caught in the [if lt IE 9] conditional comment. They also get a different
  <html> tag that contains [class="ie7"]. This is because IE7 and below don't work with the
  box-sizing trick above, so we need to define different widths on those elements. ie.css has
  several extra "reset" styles built in.
- Note: I'm using html5shiv. If you use Modernizr, that already has the shiv built in
- Note: IE 6-8 don't support media queries and will use the default 768px layout. You can use this
  script: http://code.google.com/p/css3-mediaqueries-js/ to enable your media queries in IE

I guarantee that this whole theme will change over time.
